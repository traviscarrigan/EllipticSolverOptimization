# Optimizer
A Glyph script written to demonstrate the applicability of various optimization routines for improving grid quality. 

## Usage
Open *Optimizer.glf* and specity the .pw file and domains you'd like to optimize. Setup the optimizer settings like the upper bound for number of elliptic solver iterations and tolerances. Depending on the optimization algorithm selected you may need to specify additional parameters. The algorithms included are Exhaustive Search, Golden Section, and Differential Evolution.
